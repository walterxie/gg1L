# R Plot Using One-line Function Derived From ggplot2 

In development. 

##Use my time to save your time

This package wraps ggplot2â€™s code into one-line functions, 
which are easy to use. 
It also includes some tips and smart code collected from Internet to improve plotting, 
and few visualisation methods derived from my previous or current works.

To see all exported functions:
```R
help(package = "gg1L")
```

##Installation

You can use the **devtools** *install\_github()* function to install the lastest development version directly from the GitHub.

```R
library("devtools")
devtools::install_github("walterxie/gg1L")
library("gg1L")
```
